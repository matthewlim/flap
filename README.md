how useless!

this is a toy project inspired by The Most Useless Machine, as made popular by Make Magazine:

I remember reading that the original design was housed in an old suitcase. The suitcase had a switch on it, and turning it on would slowly creak the suitcase open, causing a mannequin hand to come out and switch it off, killing the motor and clamping the suitcase shut once again. If anyone can point me toward a wiki article or a video or something describing or crediting the _original_ inventor and the very first machine, please let me know!

anyway, i decided that android could easily house such engineering majesty as well :)

not quite as mechanical, but kinda charming, i think. definitely a little dumb.
